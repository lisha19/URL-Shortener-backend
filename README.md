To set up a URL shortening website with a backend in Spring Boot (using MySQL) and a frontend in React (running on npm), follow these steps:
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (preferably version 11 or later).
MySQL database installed and running.


Download or Clone the Spring Boot Project: If you have a Spring Boot project for URL shortening, download or clone it to your local machine.

Configure application.properties : Replace the placeholders for the MySQL database connection with your actual username and password. Open the file src/main/resources/application.properties 

Access the Application:

The backend should be running at http://localhost:8081.
The frontend will typically run at http://localhost:3000.
